# WindowsAuthenticationInBlazor

This represents the answers I got when asking Claude Sonnet and ChatGPT the same questions.

## The problem domain

At work I've got to take a Blazor application I've been working on written in .NET 9, and make sure it works with Windows Authentication/Authorization in IIS and nothing else. This is an Internal website, so this is appropriate.

To that end I first asked both Claude Sonnet 4.5 and ChatGPT how this was done in the older .NET Framework 4.8.1. (Not what the old, legacy app was written in, but its close enough.) Then I asked both chatbots if the same thing could be done in .NET 9 or .NET 10, and illustrate how it could be done. Since both chatbots generate answers in Markdown, I am going to include all their answers as 4 separate Markdown files in this repo.

Note that this repo consists only of Markdown files. Although it wasn't necessary, I used the Gitigore file for Visual Studio, when creating this repo. I'm just used to using some Gitignore file.
